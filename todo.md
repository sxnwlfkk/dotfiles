# TODO for 1st project week

I'll try to do as much work this week, as I can. As I see, aside from refactoring and deleting unused or
useless features, it's before the finish line. I'll need to do some creative work, but the code is more or
less there.

* Read trough the whole project
* Determine and assign tasks

This is the work, that needs to be done, before I can call this finished:

* Set up virtualenv (HIGH PRIORITY)
* Sort out dependencies
* Sort out imports
* Kill all unused features
* Refactor for readability
* Setup.py
  * Read up on it
  * Implement
  * When project is finished, push to pypy library
  * Should be able to install with pip
* Docs for github page
  * Write workflow and example dotfile
* Find some unique name
* Release 1.0 version
